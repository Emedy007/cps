    * Director of Anemoy (BVI) Management Ltd
* Historical Loan Tape (years):
  * n/a
* Key Professional Partners (legal, accounting, operational, technical, structuring):
  * The Team is working with world class partners for the on- and offchain parts of the fund structure and processes. It is using state of the art crypto and cybersecurity tools to protect clients and their underlying assets. The Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund holds the underlying fund participations. Trident Trust provides the fund admin and middle office service. MHA Cayman is the fund auditor. Leftover cash will be held at First Citizens Bank, covered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for cash assets.
  * Research team
    * Lead by Martin Quensel, industry veterans [Sanat Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanatrao/) and [Colin Rix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-rix/) acting as advisors to select and supervise the underlying funds
  * Legal and ops
    * There are dedicated legal and operational resources to guarantee timely and professional fund services
  * Fund admininisration
    * Trident Trust, a top tier professional fund administrator in the BVI is the licensed funds administrator doing investor onboarding, accounting, and NAV calculation.
    * In addition Trident Trust provides middle office services for the AUM (the underlying fund participations). They are responsible for the correct execution of investment and redemption transactions with the underlying funds and do all the accounting including the asset side.

    * Ogier Advises Anemoy on BVI law issues and has prepared offer documents, corporate constitutional documentation and internal policies.
  * First underlying funds
    * Anemoy will start with two funds - those of Re7 Capital and Dialectic - and will further diversify to up to ten funds as the fund grows. The limitations of the underlying funds mean such a diversified portfolio can’t occur right from the start. For example, minimum investment sizes/redemptions make it impossible to support ten funds from day one. Anemoy has already selected and is in conversations with the next group of funds.
  * This POP does not require further off-chain service providers considering the focus on decentralized institutional investors like decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAOs”) and their respective treasuries, which have the capability to self-custody tokens

# Strategy

## Business

* Describe your business and go to market strategy.
  * What makes your approach unique within your industry?
    * Anemoy is creating unique onchain investment opportunities tailored to investors with stablcoins who want to diversify their investments and do not want to make is solely relying on crypto yield or give investors new investment capabilities in form of a token.
    * Based on that strategy Anemoy is starting to offering with different liquidity and risk-adjusted return profiles starting with
      * High liquidity + low risk = LTF (Liquid Treasury Fund)
      * Med liquidity + medium risk = DYF (DeFi Yield Fund)
  * Why are you a good partner for Centrifuge?
    * Anemoy is a web3 native asset manager built on Centrifuge. Each $ of Anemoy AUM is Centrifuge TVL.
  * How do you differentiate yourself from competitors?
    * Legal framework
      * The Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund (DYF) is a regulated, fully onchain fund of funds for direct access to DeFi yields through centralized asset managers. The fund is approved and regulated by the BVI Financial Services Commission (BVI FSC).
      * This is one of the few setups where the token itself if the security including offchain redemption, recourse and claims. Also a reason why Blackrock is using it for its $BUIDL token.
    * Centrifuge
      * NFT and on-chain transparency support for single asset holdings
        * Similar to LTF, where every T-bill Cusip holding is an NFT, DYF will use the Centrifuge NFTs to account for the held underlying fund shares.
    * Multichain support
      * Like LTF, DYF will be deployed on every chain where investors would like to invest and which is supported by Centrifuge.
    * Centrifuge chain
      * The Centrifuge chain is our App Chain for asset and fund management.
* How is your entity financed today, what are the current sources of capital:
  * Equity raised: n/a
  * Debt raised: n/a
* What is your entity’s revenue/fee model:
  * Origination fees: n/a
  * Target spread: n/a
  * Other: 1% management fee (see forthcoming offering materials for details)

## Capital

* Please explain the source(s) of, and ability to scale, your first-loss junior (TIN) capital in the pool:
  * Single tranche model without Junior and Senior tranches. The Fund of Funds nature of the underlying asset - fund shares of the underlying funds - does not require tranching or any further securitization.
* Please explain the source(s) of, and ability to scale, your senior (DROP) capital in the pool:
  * N/A
* Capital relationships and how much you will bring through Centrifuge KYC to invest in either senior or junior tranche of your pool:

## DeFi

* Outline why DeFi is important to your business strategy:
  * The core of this pool will be its focus on investing in a diversified bag of DeFi investment strategies.
  * Additionally, as mentioned above, an essential component of Anemoy’s broader strategy relies on providing superior risk-adjusted returns via DeFi. There is no Anemoy offering that is not tokenized and managed using DeFi at present, nor are any 100% off-chain products presently being contemplated by the Team
* Articulate why Centrifuge’s community and protocol is a fit for financing:
