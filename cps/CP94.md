## About this proposal

Upgrade Centrifuge Chain to Runtime Version 1027. 

In [RU 1026](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/blob/main/cps/CP92.md), the Anemoy pool currency changes from `Polkadot USDC` to `Local USDC` which belongs to a new asset class on Centrifuge Chain called `LocalAsset`. As part of 1026, `Local USDC` is registered and linked to existing USDC variants. The new `TokenMux` module streamlines the investment flow for variants of the same currency, i.e. USDC for now. We noticed that part of the flow is blocked by not being able to place swap orders into a currency variant from its local asset. The same result can be achieved by another API but it is not desired due to bad UX.

Moreover, the `ProxyType::Borrow` was missing permissions to execute `TokenMux` calls necessary for a good borrow flow.

Since neither of these fixes imposes any security risk and no veto from Anemoy, we decided on enacting 1026 and proposing 1027 instead of proposing to supersede 1026 for 1027.

## List of content of this Runtime Upgrade

- Fix: Enable placing Orderbook orders for local assets `CurrencyId::LocalAsset(_)`
- Permit `ProxyType::Borrow` to call `TokenMux::deposit`, `TokenMux::burn`, `TokenMux::match_swap`
- Transfer `3,274,469.850463039024292328 CFG` from the [Tinlake rewards account](https://centrifuge.subscan.io/account/5EYCAe5igNEiv9tZv6XcErvzWzHg8YDvQCgdb9BuT4B4R5nk?tab=transfer) to the [Centrifuge treasury](https://centrifuge.subscan.io/account/5EYCAe5ijiYfyeZ2JJCGq56LmPyNRAKzpG4QkoQkkQNB5e6Z) (passed with [CP81](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/blob/main/cps/CP81.md))
