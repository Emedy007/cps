Founding Document Part Four: Code of Conduct

Common to any group trying to do something big and complex, conflicts can occur.  We are designing this Code of Conduct to avoid harm to our community and its culture, and to minimize distractions from our shared mission. To be a superbly functioning DAO it’s necessary for members to go beyond our own idea of ​​'right' behavior and agree to a shared set of standards defined in a Code of Conduct (CoC).

Our Code of Conduct is designed to: 
- Encourage respect, professionalism and mutual understanding. 
- Create an inclusive and harassment-free environment. 
- Provide a way to minimize toxic conflict.

This CoC regulates not only what is considered acceptable and unacceptable, but also describes the offboarding steps for individuals who repeatedly violate the Code.
