Founding Document Part Two: DAO Principles

Achieving our Shared Mission is going to be hard. We need to coordinate exceptionally well. Principles should guide us in how we act, think, and work in the DAO to actualize our Mission. We would like to propose two sets of principles; Guiding Principles and Operating Principles.
Guiding Principles are guidelines that help our decision-making. They draw out the values from the Shared Mission and make them explicit.
