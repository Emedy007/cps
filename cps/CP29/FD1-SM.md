# Founding Document Part One: The Shared Mission

For Centrifuge to become a successful protocol it will require working together towards one overarching goal, or ‘mission’. Because what we're building is on-chain (i.e. run on transparent, resilient, and automated infrastructure) it follows that the organizational structure should be run as transparently, resiliently, and as automatically as possible. Therefore we choose to organize as a DAO and make use of the coordination gains that a shared mission can give us, these can include:

* Decentralized Ownership: Minimizing extractive concentrations of power and ownership
* Open access: Anyone can propose changes or improvements
* Distributed Decision Making: Decision making pushed outwards from one to many, and in the process utilizing collective intelligence to make better decisions

Distributed decision making is critical and this can only happen if there is high-quality Knowledge Transfer. If knowledge transfer is done effectively, AND combined with distributed decision making AND open access, we can enable a platform driven approach to on-chain credit. The affordances of DAOs outlined above can minimize malicious gatekeeping and inequitable power structures, while facilitating effective decision making at scale.

By using these advantages, we can unleash the inherent properties of DAO organizing and see countless opportunities, deals, and collaborations occurring at the same time, ushering in product market fit (ultimately across many products) for Centrifuge and its users.

However, alongside all these benefits come challenges. 

A DAO is like a startup on steroids: the open and networked nature described above presents us with a thousand paths we could take to achieve product market fit, and if we follow them all at once, we’ll never get there. Competing alternative paths become championed by people and groups who start to see each other as rivals. Politics take priority and coordination breakdown follows.

It becomes clear why a Shared Mission is one crucial tool that will enable us to coordinate and utilize the networked promise of DAOs. Our Shared Mission guides us in our actions and decisions;  It is the ultimate destination we all agree upon. In order to be potent it is a short, clear, and easy to remember sentence that describes what we are trying to achieve.

*We propose the following Shared Mission* 

**Bring the world of credit on-chain**

Why is this the most important destination that we should all work towards?

Because as many of us know, finance gives people the power to transform ideas into reality, yet traditionally only large corporations can access the capital they need to invest and grow. By contrast, millions of small businesses, owned and operated by ordinary people, are locked out of accessing these same benefits.

Those who work on Centrifuge believe that financial services should be accessible to everyone. We make finance fair by getting credit to those who need it most in an inexpensive and fast way. Together we are building the credit infrastructure for the future and bringing the world of credit on-chain by creating a platform which allows borrowers and lenders to transact without unnecessary intermediaries via new accessible financial tools. 
We’re creating a new, open world where traditional finance will have no choice but to follow. One where investors can provide the capital borrowers need, open access is the norm, and capital is affordable to all. 

The Shared Mission ***‘Bring the world of credit on-chain’*** serves as the guiding vision and collective purpose for Centrifuge.
