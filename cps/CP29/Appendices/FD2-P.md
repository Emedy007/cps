# Founding Document Part Two: DAO Principles

Achieving our Shared Mission is going to be hard. We need to coordinate exceptionally well. Principles should guide us in how we act, think, and work in the DAO to actualize our Mission. We would like to propose two sets of principles; *Guiding Principle* and *Operating Principles*.

**Guiding Principles** are guidelines that help our decision-making. They draw out the values from the Shared Mission and make them explicit.

*Proposed Guiding Principles*

* **Open access**: We work to give open access to the new financial system.
* **Transparency**: We avoid the pitfalls of traditional, centralized financial systems by designing for and committing to transparency.
* **Long term thinking**: We focus on the long term horizons of the protocol.
* **Integrity**: We believe in upholding high moral and ethical standards

**Operating Principles** describe how contributors put guiding principles and the shared mission into practice to get things done.

*Proposed Operating Principles*

* We **choose simple over complicated**: Reduction of unnecessary steps makes it easier to get things done. As we progressively decentralize and distribute decision making we avoid governance overload i.e. asking all community members to vote on all things.
* We **work out loud**: Working out loud generates feedback, helps us come to better decisions, and promotes transparency. We commit to openly communicate and share the work we are doing.
* We **propose solutions to identified problems**: Seek solutions to problems, be proactive in owning and constructively finding ways forward, and look for feedback to make the solutions better.
* We **use direct and honest communication**: It is important to communicate clearly and honestly in order to resolve issues and move forward. Avoiding sensitive topics or not addressing them is not helpful. Being direct and honest in a respectful way helps to achieve mutual understanding and agreement.
* We **cooperate and assume positive intentions**: Interpreting actions as hostile leads to conflict that possibly wasnâ€™t there in the first place. In all our community channels including forum, social, calls, meetings and discussions we assume goodwill. We moderate bad faith behavior, as defined by our Code of Conduct.
