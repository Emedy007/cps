# Founding Document Part Three: Levels of Engagement

![](../CP29/Images/LoE.png)

People are involved in Centrifuge for various reasons, with different ambitions, interests, and levels of engagement. Some actively participate in all aspects of governance (discussion and voting), some only in certain parts of the project and others don’t actively participate at all. In order to keep our discussions constructive and productive, and to engage people on relevant matters who have relevant expertise, we propose these levels of engagement.

### Daily Contributors

These are people or entities who contribute to the protocol and or DAO on a daily or near daily basis. They form the foundational working groups of the DAO, working actively and consistently to achieve Centrifuge’s shared mission. These contributors typically work on Centrifuge full-time. Examples include:

* Ambassadors
* The CNF team 
* The k/f team 
* Moderators
* Certain group members and partners

### Active Contributors 

These are people/entities who actively contribute to the Centrifuge protocol and/or DAO. These contributors engage in forum discussions, governance calls, token voting, pool launches, integrations, and Centrifuge promotions. Examples include:

* Asset Originators
* Ambassadors
* VCs 
* Protocol and DeFi partners
* Collators
* Group members

Daily and Active contributors are considered Core Contributors and are given different privileges and responsibilities depending on their role. See Appendix 1 for access and benefit details.

### Passive Contributors

These are typically community members who hold tokens but are not actively engaged in the project and thus not invited to the DAO Slack or Core Contributors call.

### Changing Levels of Engagement

It is possible for a DAO member to move levels - both up and down. Any contributor can increase their access if they start contributing regularly in a meaningful way to the DAO, via governance, forum discussions, call participation, or by being part of a project that contributes to the protocol.

For more details about the criteria to move levels, see Appendix 1.

## Appendix 1

### Daily Contributors
* Can invite members to become Active Contributors via a consent based vote in the #newmembers slack channel
* Very high participation on protocol building and adoption
* Weekly/bi-weekly calls with CNF, K/F Team
* Participation in off-site meetings, and conferences
* Know and steward the strategy, direction and of the DAO

### Active Contributors
* Can call themselves Core Contributors of the Centrifuge DAO
* Access to strategy and vision in smaller, expert groups
* The DAO Slack (invite only)
* 1 monthly Active and Daily Contributors only DAO call on strategy, adoption and product

### Passive Contributors
* Access to all information via our public channels (Forum, Medium, Discord, Telegram, Twitter and newsletters)
* Can participate in governance and public online events (Community + Governance Call, AMA etc.)

### Criteria for Changing Levels

**Passive Contributors -> Active Contributors**

Any Daily Contributor can invite a Passive Contributor to become an Active Contributor - via a consent based vote - if they fulfill either of the following criteria:

* Their contribution to the DAO requires access to specific communication channels
* They contribute regularly to the development of the protocol
* They participate actively and regularly in Governance/Community Calls, Forum discussions, AMAs, live events with quality input

Measuring *regularly* and *quality input* can be challenging but we define *regularly* as consistent and stable contribution over a period of time - and *quality input* means giving constructive feedback on proposals/ideas and coming up with new ideas for how to improve the protocol/DAO and expand the ecosystem.

**Passive Contributors/Active Contributors -> Daily Contributors**

In order to become a Daily Contributor, a DAO member would need to be part of the aforementioned entities and/or contribute to the development of the protocol on a near daily basis.

**Active Contributor -> Passive Contributor**

DAO levels can be changed for several reasons:

* Personal decision. If a member no longer wishes to be a part of the DAO or would like to contribute less.
* Inactivity. After 90 days of inactivity, the level of a contributor can be decreased.
* As a consequence of violating the CoC.

Inquiries regarding access and level changes should be addressed to the GCG.
