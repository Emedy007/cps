## Short Summary

This proposal aims to fix incorrect Protocol Fees that were set during the onboarding of the pool


## High level objective

The objective of this proposal is to remove the incorrect value of 40 b.p of Protocol Fees.


## Background

The [CP110: (POP) Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund 1](https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/cp110-pop-anemoy-defi-yield-fund-1/6400 ) was approved by Centrifuge token holders on the date 2024-05-27. 

The Protocol Fees were set, incorrectly, to 40 bps ( 0.400% of NAV ) during the deployment of the pool.

Unfortunately, changing the value of the Protocol Fees is not immediately possible. The Protocol Fees rates can not be changed via extrinsic call and can be only removed and added again with the desired new rate after.

This CP aims to remove the incorrect value of Protocol Fees and set the correct value of 7.5 bp of Protocol Fees for Anemoy DeFi Yield Fund 1.

Given the urgency of this proposal, the voting period for the referendum will be 7,200 blocks (24 hours).

## Alignment to the mission of Centrifuge DAO
The correct fee value is crucial for running the Anemoy DYF Pool and onboarding new investors, which has a crucial impact on the financial stability of the CFG Protocol.
