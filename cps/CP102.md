## Short Summary
I propose that the Centrifuge treasury make an additional CFG deposit  of **750k CFG ($527k)** into the HydraDX Omnipool to further increase Polkadot on-chain liquidity for CFG.

## High level objective
This 750k CFG is 5% of the treasury and would bring the CFG treasury deposit in the Omnipool up to 1.25M CFG ($878.6k) or 0.22% of FDV. This would significantly reduce trading slippage of CFG within the Polkadot ecosystem and enable lending and borrowing markets.

## Background
The Centrifuge treasury in June 2023 deposited 500k CFG into the Omnipool, currently valued at $351,450. https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/rfc-listing-cfg-in-hydradx-omnipool-seeding-initial-liquidity/5412

The 24-hour trading volume of CFG in the Omnipool is $120k with an APR of 6.04% and can be seen at: [https://app.hydradx.io/stats/overview](https://app.hydradx.io/stats/overview)
As you can see, the Centrifuge treasury deposit into the Omnipool has maintained its value over time. (the acct value in terms of CFG tokens is lower because the CFG token value increased while the stablecoins in the Omnipool did not, and they make up 20% of the Omnipool)

## Description of Activity
With the existing CFG in the Omnipool you can only trade 16k CFG ($13,366) per trade before hitting 2% slippage. Recently in twitter discussions an investment firm mentioned they tried to buy 600k ASTR ($76k) recently but slippage was too high and they had to use a CEX instead.

DCA helps you break up large trades, but this reinforces the fact that we should continue to deepen our liquidity across the Polkadot ecosystem. Let’s bring those fees on-chain to Polkadot!

Another reason to increase CFG liquidity on-chain is to support larger money markets for CFG. HydraDX is launching a lending platform soon and increasing Omnipool liquidity would support a larger max cap if and when the HydraDX community decides to list CFG on their money market. This would enable another use case for CFG hodlers.

Again with my thesis of using treasury-controlled funds to increase liquidity across the entire Polkadot ecosystem I would separately encourage the CFG treasury to deposit CFG liquidity ($200k?) into a CFG lending market on HydraDX to enable larger borrowing positions. (but that would be a separate future Centrifuge proposal) Interlay also has money markets but can't list tokens that have 18 decimal places like CFG. Bifrost has also launched their Loop Stake lending market but are currently only supporting their vTokens. So there is only a future opportunity for a CFG money market on Hydra.

## Change or improvement
The great thing about all of the proposals above is that they put to use “Treasury Owned Liquidity”.
* earn fees
* add token use cases
* deepen liquidity
* no “listing fee” or reoccurring costs for market making or LM
* tokens aren’t “spent” and are still controlled by the Centrifuge community.

**Q:** But how much in fees?

**A:** Omnipool stats show CFG deposits earning 6.04% from swap fees. Deposits into lending would likely earn 3-8% once they are borrowed.

**Q:** But $527k from the treasury is a lot!!

**A:** Based on several CFG/Astar/Interlay governance proposals, the "cost of capital" is **$2400/month** to incentivize each **$100k** in DEX liquidity for a team's token. The Centrifuge treasury currently has $400k of CFG deposited into the Omnipool as Protocol Owned Liquidity. If the treasury were instead incentivizing this $400k liquidity with pure token incentives, it would cost about $2,400 x ($400k/$100k) = $9.6k each month. Over 10 months this would have cost $90.6k. (and you can see from governance proposals, other treasuries are indeed paying this magnitude of incentives to DEXs to encourage liquidity) Therefore although it requires a much larger up-front deposit of tokens (which might not have been put to use sitting in the treasury anyways), the reoccurring cost for providing this DEX liquidity as a service to the Centrifuge community is significantly cheaper, if anything at all.

I've been encouraging multiple teams to deposit $1M of liquidity to send a strong “we’re open for business” signal from a cohesive Polkadot community, with minimal risk for each treasury and demonstrating the power of XCM to control funds on other chains. Astar governance deposited 5.54M ASTR more ($500k) into the Omnipool (https://forum.astar.network/t/deposit-additional-astr-into-hydradx-omnipool/6507) and Bifrost governance just deposited 1.25M BNC more ($540k). Interlay treasury had already deposited $750k of INTR and we’re discussing boosting it to $1.2M.

## Alignment to the mission of Centrifuge DAO
* increase use case for CFG token and earn revenue without 'spending' any token assets
* I have reviewed the March “Updated Treasury Spending Agreement” and earnestly believe that POL strategies are one of the best uses of treasury funds.

## Delivery and Reporting

You can only deposit or withdraw up to 5% of the existing pool liquidity for a token in each block. This was a result of a vulnerability report from a whitehat in March 2023 which is documented here: https://hydradx.substack.com/p/security-update-1. On the HydraDX Liquidity page you can try to add CFG liquidity and the UI will inform you that the current max for a single deposit is 46745 CFG.

The workaround for this is to use the `scheduler` pallet to break the large deposit into chunks. The Hydra chain includes the scheduler pallet, but it can only be used by governance. Luckily the Centrifuge chain includes the scheduler pallet, so in a single referenda Centrifuge governance can schedule a repeated XCM call to deposit each chunk of CFG liquidity into the Omnipool. Similarly if the Centrifuge community ever wanted to withdraw their liquidity they could do so with a set of calls to repeatedly remove each LP position, up to 5% at a time. The HydraDX team has an open GitHub issue to add a call to gradually add/remove large liquidity positions: https://github.com/galacticcouncil/HydraDX-node/issues/802

One negative side effect of breaking up the liquidity deposit into multiple chunks is that you receive a separate NFT representing each LP position. In the Wallet → Liquidity Positions area of the HydraDX UI, it shows each LP NFT as a separate ‘card’. The Hydra team has now also created an aggregated view of liquidity for each token so that it's easy to see the treasury's performance across all of the LP deposits.

Therefore the on-chain preimage/extrinsics to execute this proposal will:
1) Transfer the 750k CFG (plus 20 CFG for XCM fees buffer) to Centrifuge sibling acct on HydraDX chain (7LCt6dFsJVukxnxpix9KcTkwu2kWQnXARsy6BuBHEL54NcS6)
2) Schedule once every 1 block repeating 20 times to deposit 37,500 CFG into the Omnipool using `omnipool.addLiquidity(13,37500000000000000000000)`. This will take about 4.5 minutes to execute at 12 sec/block.

The entire call is encoded as: `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`

Real-time value of the Centrifuge treasury CFG deposits in the Omnipool can be monitored at: [https://app.hydradx.io/wallet/assets?account=7LCt6dFsJVukxnxpix9KcTkwu2kWQnXARsy6BuBHEL54NcS6](https://app.hydradx.io/wallet/assets?account=7LCt6dFsJVukxnxpix9KcTkwu2kWQnXARsy6BuBHEL54NcS6)

In Polkadot.js you can check chain state to get the CFG token balance with: `tokens->accounts(Sibling 2031)`
In Polkadot.js you can get the list of LP NFTs with: `uniques->account(Sibling 2031, 1337)`
In Polkadot.js you can get the exact size/stats of each LP deposit/NFT like: `omnipool->positions(2398)`

There is a good Dune dashboard for HydraDX: [https://dune.com/substrate/hydradx](https://dune.com/substrate/hydradx)

The Parity data team also have some good monthly graphs: [Parity Data Dashboards - Monthly Report](https://dashboards.data.paritytech.io/eoyr.html)


Regarding Omnipool security of the Centrifuge community's deposit, I would recommend reading the list of HydraDX security measures: https://docs.hydradx.io/omnipool_security/

I am especially impressed with how they’ve been able to customize their Polkadot chain to apply security checks on every block produced. They also have an Immunefi bounty and recently participated in a code4rena contest to get whitehats to find any lingering vulnerabilities
