# POP - Process
![](../CP5/Appendices/popv3s.png)

## Step 1 - Propose Pool
- Submit POP to the community governance forum for a Request For Comment (RFC) period.
 - Allow for a minimum of 7 days for discussion with the community and the Centrifuge Credit Group, who may volunteer to do an analysis of the proposed pool at their own discretion and share it with the community. Credit Group participation is not guaranteed.
-  The Applicant can host a Pool Party if they would like to engage with community and allow the community to ask questions.

## Step 2 - Launch
- To prepare to launch the pool, the POP must go to a vote.
- For an on-chain vote, the applicant must submit their POP to Github. The Governance & Coordination Group (@ImdioR or @Rhano) can help facilitate the GitHub submission if needed.
- An on-chain proposal is then initiated directly from the Centrifuge App to sub-square for all CFG token holders to vote on (Minimum of 7 days). If it passes the vote the pool will be live on the Centrifuge app.
Propose a pool (RFC using the POP template) - minimum 7 day discussion
- During this period the Credit Group may choose work with the issuer to publish an assessment of the pool
- The prospective issuer should engage the community and utilize Governance Calls, 1:1 relationships and the Forum, in order to gather support for their POP
