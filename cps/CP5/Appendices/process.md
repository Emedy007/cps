# POP - Process

## Step 1 - Proposal

Propose a pool (RFC using the POP template) - minimum 7 day discussion
- During this period the Credit Group may choose work with the issuer to publish an assessment of the pool
- The prospective issuer should engage the community and utilize Governance Calls, 1:1 relationships and the Forum, in order to gather support for their POP
## Step 2 - Launch

Onchain governance vote to onboard Pool - minimum 7 day voting period:
After 7 days of discussion and engagement of Step 1 (the RFC) the issuer can propose the pool launch by submitting the democracy proposal. To speed up the process the issuer can petition the council to fasttrack the proposal.
This would allow any issuer, sponsor, originator, or fund to have a live, open Pool on Centrifuge in a minimum of 14 days.
