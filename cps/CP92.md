## About this proposal

Upgrade Centrifuge Chain to Runtime Version 1026.

## Centrifuge 1026 - Release Notes Highlights
This release is packed with new features and a few breaking changes. Most notably, the definition of the NAV has changed. So far, the NAV represented the so called assets under management (abbreviated by AUM) which are represented by the evaluation of existing loans:
```
- NAV := NAV(Loans)
```
With the introduction of Pool Fees, the definition of the NAV needs to be extended due to the reducing effect which the sum of pending pool fees have on the pool valuation, i.e. they represent the negative part. Please note that the Pool Fees NAV does not include disbursement amounts which can be paid during epoch execution because these already reduce the reserve.

```
+ NAV := min(PoolReserve + NAV(Loans) - NAV(PoolFees), 0)
```

Please replace any existing reserve and NAV query with the new runtime API added in [#1703](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1703):

```
let { navAum, navFees, reserve, total: navTotal } =
    await api.call.poolsApi.nav(poolId)
```

Please note that runtime API metadata is not included in the v14 metadata such that you need to [add type and runtime API call decorations manually](https://github.com/centrifuge/apps/blob/a3d9cba127139703aba2e53b760a0261a87f6ec4/centrifuge-js/src/CentrifugeBase.ts#L104-L179).
