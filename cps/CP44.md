## List of content of this Runtime Upgrade

We are excited to announce the inclusion of Pools in the Centrifuge runtime, a significant enhancement to our platform. As a result, investors will now have the opportunity to invest in RWA Pools on the purpose-built Centrifuge chain, which operates under the robust security umbrella of Polkadot. This new feature complements the existing Tinlake on Ethereum, expanding investment options for our valued users.

* Add pallets for `PoolRegistry`, `PoolSystem`, `Permissions`, `Investments` and `InterestAccrual` ([PR #1233](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1233))
* Refactor `pallet-loans` to allow better scalability in loans. Instead of choosing between fixed loan types, they can now be composed with different valuations/restrictions/schedulesâ€”improvements in the written-off systems and a lot of simplifications to reason easier about loans as a borrower ([PR #1180](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1180))
    * For more details, please check the [corresponding specification](https://centrifuge.hackmd.io/2h9F9m45Qo2mIMZs9e6Z1Q?view)
* Significantly improved interest rate accrual and NAV update efficiency ([PR #1157](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1157))
* Added new proxy type `PermissionManagement` which will be used for adding new investors by onboarding API ([PR #1197](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1197))
