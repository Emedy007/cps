## About this proposal

We discovered two minor bugs on Centrifuge which need to be hotfixed. They don't impose a security issue but block the Anemoy pool from advancing its epoch.

Therefore, we need to perform another minor Centrifuge RU to version 1028 ASAP.

## List of content of this Runtime Upgrade

- Fix: Unblock `update_collection` call by reducing PoV requirements
- Fix: Registers active loans of Anemoy Pool in OracleCollection pallet

## WASM
