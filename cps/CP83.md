## Short Summary
Proposal to update the current CP28: Centrifuge Protocol Fees

## High-Level Objective
This proposal, if passes, will introduce and add different pool fees for different types of pools.

## Description of Activity

With the recent introduction of Pool Types with CP63, which can be found [here](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/blob/main/cps/CP63.md), the use cases of Centrifuge Protocol was extended.

However, the fees on the Centrifuge Chain with CP28 was set previously to 40bp (**0.4%**) for all pools on the Centrifuge Chain.

This fee cannot be applied and is not suitable for all pools due to the different risks, management time, and liquidity associated with different product types.

With this regard, we propose to the DAO to introduce and set specific fees for these types of pools:

### Closed(Private) Pools

* Private Credit & Securities fees **0.15%**
* Public Securities & Equities fees **0.02%**

### Open Pools

* Private Credit & Securities fees **0.4%**
* Public Securities & Equities fees **0.075%**

### Portfolio(Prime) Pools fees:

* **0.35%** p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M ( < $ 50,000,000)
* **0.2%** p.a. on assets in Prime between $50M ( > $ 50,000,000) and $100M ( < $ 100,000,000)
* **0.1%** p.a. on assets in Prime above $100M ( > $ 100,000,000)

The fee will be set for each pool on pool creation on-chain.

## Change or improvement

- Introduce specific fees for different types of pools
- Set the fee for each pool on pool creation

## Alignment to the mission of Centrifuge DAO

Introducing different pool types fees will allow Centrifuge Protocol to better align with product strategy and offer unique product characteristics and fees associated with each product.

This fee approach will help Protocol to offer the best product and remain competitive in the market.
