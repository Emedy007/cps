## About this proposal

This proposal will send a registrar.swap call via XCM from Centrifuge to Polkadot.
We are set to renew our Centrifuge parachain as the lease expires in two months, having secured eight new leases via para ID 3353, entirely self funded without a crowdloan. The lease swap from 3353 requires an XCM from Centrifuge to Polkadot for completion. This action will exchange our current lease for the new ones.

## List of content:

- Send the encapsulated XCM to Polkadot which executes registrar.swap(2031, 3353).
