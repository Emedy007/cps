# CP2 (Request for Funding)

Any entity (group or individual) who seeks funding from the Treasury, would need to create a proposal, using the CP2 component. There can be different scenarios for an entity applying for funding:

- The entity already created a proposal using both the CP1 and CP2 component (that passed), 
received funding and wants to re-apply
- The entity already created a proposal using the CP1 component (that passed) and wants to apply for funding
- The entity doesnâ€™t have a mandate but wants to apply for funding for a one time service

The Treasury is administered by the Council so only the Council will vote on the proposal - token holders will not vote on it.

It is possible to make a Treasury proposal on behalf of someone else.

A Treasury proposal can only be made if there are adequate funds in it to cover the funding request.

When creating a request for funding, make sure to provide the calculations for the requested amount and how they will be distributed. You can see an example of how it can be done in [this post](https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/cp117-give-a-mandate-to-form-the-treasury-advisory-group/6464).

**If the request is above equivalent of $50,000, the milestone based funding process below will be followed.**
