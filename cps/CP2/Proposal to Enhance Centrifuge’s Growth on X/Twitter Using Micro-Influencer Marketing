Introduction

Centrifuge is an innovative project with significant potential, but its growth on X/Twitter has been limited. A strong presence on X is crucial to attracting investors, expanding the community, and increasing engagement. This proposal presents a strategic solution to boost Centrifuge’s visibility and engagement through micro-influencer marketing.
